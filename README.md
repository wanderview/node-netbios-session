# netbios-session

A 100% javascript implemention of the NetBIOS session protocol defined in
[RFC1001][] and [RFC1002][].

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wanderview/node-netbios-session.png)](https://travis-ci.org/wanderview/node-netbios-session)

## Example

    var Session = require('netbios-session')
    var net = require('net');

    var NAME = null;

    var server = net.createServer(function(socket) {
      console.log('---> new connection from [' + socket.remoteAddress + ']');
      var session = new Session();
      session.attach(socket, function(error, request) {
        if (error) {
          console.log('---> attach error [' + error + ']');
          return;
        }

        console.log('---> new call to [' + request.callTo + '] from [' +
                    request.callFrom + ']');

        if (NAME && request.callTo.name !== NAME) {
          console.log('---> rejecting');
          request.reject('Not listening on called name');
          return;
        }

        session.on('message', function(msg) {
          console.log('---> received a message with [' + msg.length + '] bytes');
        });

        console.log('---> accepting');
        request.accept();
      });
    });

    server.listen(139, function() {
      console.log('server started');
    });

## Limitations

This module provides a useful set of functionality from the RFCs, but it is
still a work in progress.

Please be aware of the following limitations:

* Currently the code does not support session retargeting.  This can be used
  to instruct a client to close its current connection and try again at a
  different address.  Currently redirection responses are ignored.
* The API should be considered unstable as it may change in future versions.

Feedback, testing help, and pull requests welcome.

## Class: NetbiosSession

The NetbiosSession class represents a message based session with a remote
host.  There is an initial session negotiation process that requires the
caller to request a new session for a particular name.  The other peer
can then accept or reject the request.  Once a request has been accepted the
session is considered to be connected.  At this point messages can be sent
and received.

NetbiosSession inherits from [EventEmitter][] class.

### new NetbiosSession(options)

Create a new NetbiosSession instance with the given `options`.

* `options` {Object | null} Optional configuration options for the session.
  Possible values are:
  * `defaultAccept` {Boolean} If set to `true`, then the session will default
    to accepting all requests if an `attach()` `callback` is not provided.
    Default value is `false`

### session.attach(socket, callback)

Attach the session to a `net.Socket` instance and wait to receive an incoming
NetBIOS session request.  This is typically used to handle in the `net.Server`
`'connection'` event.

If provided, the `callback` will be called when the request is initiated.  It
is also important for the `callback` implementation to either accept or reject
the request.  This is done by calling `request.accept()` or `request.reject()`.
If neither of these methods is called, then the session request negotiation
process will stall.  If a `callback` is not provided, then the default
policy will be used to either reject or accept.

* `socket` {Socket Object} The socket to attach to.  This socket should
  already be bound and connected.
* `callback` {Function | null} An optional callback that is used to signal
  that a request has occured and to approve or deny the request.
  * `error` {Error Object} Provided if an error occurs during the attachment.
  * `request` {Object} An object describing the session request and providing
    method to allow the `callback` to `accept()` or `reject()` the request.
    NOTE:  One of these methods must be called.
    * `callTo` {NetbiosName} The [NetbiosName][] object representing the
      service the session is trying to connect to.
    * `callFrom` {NetbiosName} The [NetbiosName][] object representing the
      service that is initiating the session.
    * `accept` {Function} Call this method to accept the request and allow
      the session to proceed.  Can be called asynchronously
    * `reject` {Function} Call this method to reject the request and to
      close the underlying socket.  A `reason` string can optionally be
      provided.  The `reject()` method can be called asynchronously.
      * `reason` {String | null} A string from an enumerated list of values
        that can optionally be provided.  If not specified then `Unspecified
        error` is used.  See below for other valid reasons.

Valid reason strings are:

* `'Not listening on called name'`
* `'Not listening for calling name'`
* `'Called name not present'`
* `'Called name present, but insufficient resources'`
* `'Unspecified error'`

### session.connect(port, host, callTo, callFrom, callback)

Initiate a new NetBIOS session with a remote host.  This method will open a
new socket and connect to the given `host` and `port`.  A session will then
be requested for the given `callTo` name coming from the given `callFrom`
name.  These must be [NetbiosName][] object instances.  The remote host
can then accept or reject the session based on the names provided.  The
`callback` will be called once the connection successfully completes or
has been rejected.

* `port` {Number} The remote port number to connect to.  Normally this should
  be port 139 for most NetBIOS session servers.
* `host` {String} The remote host name to connect to.
* `callTo` {NetbiosName Object} The [NetbiosName][] representing the service
  you are trying to connect to.
* `callFrom` {NetbiosName Object} The [NetbiosName][] representing the local
  service initiating the session.
* `callback` {Function | null}  The function that will be called once both
  the underlying socket and the session have fully connected.
  * `error` {Error Object | null} If an error occurred it will be passed.  If
    the connection was rejected, then `error` will be set with the result code
    provided by the remote host.

### session.write(msg, callback)

Write the given `msg` out to the remote session peer.  If the message can
be fully flushed to the kernel, then `write()` will return `true`.  If `false`
is returned, you should wait until the next `'drain'` event before writing
more data to the session.

* `msg` {Buffer Object} The message `Buffer` to send to the remote session
  peer.  Note, the message can be at most `NetbiosSession.MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`
  bytes long.
* `callback` {Function | null}  Optional function that will be called once
  the `msg` object has been written out or when an error occurs.
  * `error` {Error Object | null} The error that occurred, if any.

### session.pause()

Stop accepting messages from the remote session peer.  This can be used
to implement back pressure if the messages are coming too fast.

### session.resume()

Resume accepting message from the remote session peer.

### Constant: `session.MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`

Maximum number of bytes that can be passed to a single `write()` method
call to be sent as a message.  Also, messages received will not exceed
this limit as well.

### Event: 'connect'

When the NetbiosSession has negotiated and established a new session, the
`'connect'` event will be emitted.

### Event: 'message'

Whenever a message is received from the remote session peer, a `'message'`
event will be emitted.

* `msg` {Buffer Object}  A `Buffer` containing the message received.

### Event: 'end'

The `'end'` event is emitted when the session can no longer send or receive
messages.

### Event: 'error'

The `'error'` event is emitted when an error is encountered.

* `error` {Error Object} The error that occured.
