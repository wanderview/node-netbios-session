# netbios-session

A 100% javascript implemention of the NetBIOS session protocol defined in
[RFC1001][] and [RFC1002][].

NOTE: This module needs major rework.  Its currently designed around a streams
API, but NetBIOS sessions and protocols that use it, like SMB, are message
oriented.  Expect the API to change drastically.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wanderview/node-netbios-session.png)](https://travis-ci.org/wanderview/node-netbios-session)

## Example

    var Session = require('netbios-session')
    var net = require('net');

    var NAME = null;
    var FWD_PORT = 445;
    var FWD_HOST = '127.0.0.1';

    var server = net.createServer(function(socket) {
      console.log('---> new connection from [' + socket.remoteAddress + ']');
      var session = new Session();
      session.attach(socket, function(error, request) {
        if (error) {
          console.log('---> attach error [' + error + ']');
          return;
        }

        console.log('---> new call to [' + request.callTo + '] from [' +
                    request.callFrom + ']');

        if (NAME && request.callTo.name !== NAME) {
          console.log('---> rejecting');
          request.reject('Not listening on called name');
          return;
        }

        console.log('---> accepting');
        request.accept();

        var output = new net.createConnection(FWD_PORT, FWD_HOST, function() {
          console.log('---> forwarding to [' + FWD_HOST + '] on port [' + FWD_PORT +
                      ']');
          session.pipe(output);
        });
      });
    });

    server.listen(139, function() {
      console.log('netbios-fwd started');
    });

## Limitations

This module provides a useful set of functionality from the RFCs, but it is
still a work in progress.

Please be aware of the following limitations:

* Currently the code does not support session redirection.  This can be used
  to instruct a client to close its current connection and try again at a
  different address.  Currently redirection responses are ignored.
* The API should be considered unstable as it may change in future versions.

Feedback, testing help, and pull requests welcome.

## Class: NetbiosSession

The NetbiosSession inherits from the streams2 [Duplex][] class.  This means
that in addition to the methods below, there are additional methods for
reading and writing bytes.

Reading bytes will return data received from the remote session peer.  For
documentation on these methods see the [Readable][] class API.

Writing bytes will send the given data to the remote session peer.  For
documention on these methods see the [Writable][] class API.

### new NetbiosSession(options)

Create a new NetbiosSession instance with the given `options`.

* `options` {Object | null} Optional configuration options for the session.
  Possible values are:
  * `defaultAccept` {Boolean} If set to `true`, then the session will default
    to accepting all requests if an `attach()` `callback` is not provided.
    Default value is `false`

### session.attach(socket, callback)

Attach the session to a `net.Socket` instance and wait to receive an incoming
NetBIOS session request.  This is typically used to handle in the `net.Server`
`'connection'` event.

If provided, the `callback` will be called when the request is initiated.  It
is also important for the `callback` implementation to either accept or reject
the request.  This is done by calling `request.accept()` or `request.reject()`.
If neither of these methods is called, then the session request negotiation
process will stall.  If a `callback` is not provided, then the default
policy will be used to either reject or accept.

* `socket` {Socket Object} The socket to attach to.  This socket should
  already be bound and connected.
* `callback` {Function | null} An optional callback that is used to signal
  that a request has occured and to approve or deny the request.
  * `error` {Error Object} Provided if an error occurs during the attachment.
  * `request` {Object} An object describing the session request and providing
    method to allow the `callback` to `accept()` or `reject()` the request.
    NOTE:  One of these methods must be called.
    * `callTo` {NetbiosName} The [NetbiosName][] object representing the
      service the session is trying to connect to.
    * `callFrom` {NetbiosName} The [NetbiosName][] object representing the
      service that is initiating the session.
    * `accept` {Function} Call this method to accept the request and allow
      the session to proceed.  Can be called asynchronously
    * `reject` {Function} Call this method to reject the request and to
      close the underlying socket.  A `reason` string can optionally be
      provided.  The `reject()` method can be called asynchronously.
      * `reason` {String | null} A string from an enumerated list of values
        that can optionally be provided.  If not specified then `Unspecified
        error` is used.  See below for other valid reasons.

Valid reason strings are:

* `'Not listening on called name'`
* `'Not listening for calling name'`
* `'Called name not present'`
* `'Called name present, but insufficient resources'`
* `'Unspecified error'`

### session.connect(port, host, callTo, callFrom, callback)

Initiate a new NetBIOS session with a remote host.  This method will open a
new socket and connect to the given `host` and `port`.  A session will then
be requested for the given `callTo` name coming from the given `callFrom`
name.  These must be [NetbiosName][] object instances.  The remote host
can then accept or reject the session based on the names provided.  The
`callback` will be called once the connection successfully completes or
has been rejected.

* `port` {Number} The remote port number to connect to.  Normally this should
  be port 139 for most NetBIOS session servers.
* `host` {String} The remote host name to connect to.
* `callTo` {NetbiosName Object} The [NetbiosName][] representing the service
  you are trying to connect to.
* `callFrom` {NetbiosName Object} The [NetbiosName][] representing the local
  service initiating the session.
* `callback` {Function | null}  The function that will be called once both
  the underlying socket and the session have fully connected.
  * `error` {Error Object | null} If an error occurred it will be passed.  If
    the connection was rejected, then `error` will be set with the result code
    provided by the remote host.
